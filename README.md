# Biodiversity Hotspot Exploration: Cape Floristic Region

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage imaging spectroscopy data to explore and visualize the biodiversity in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Using EMIT data from NASA, along with additional biodiversity datasets, we present a holistic view of the region's ecology and its dynamics in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the required libraries and tools installed. Detailed in the `Prerequisites` section below.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks` directory for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, geopandas, folium, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data

### Raw Data

Located in the `data/raw` directory:
- EMIT Spectroscopy Data: `data/raw/EMIT_data`
- Additional Biodiversity Data: `data/raw/biodiversity_data`

### Processed Data

After preprocessing, the cleaned and transformed data is saved in the `data/processed` directory.

## Analysis

The analysis is documented step by step in the Jupyter Notebook, covering:
- Spectral Diversity Analysis
- Habitat Mapping
- Species Distribution Mapping
- Ecosystem Health Monitoring

## Visualization

Within the Jupyter Notebook, you'll find various visualizations including:
- Interactive Maps
- Spectral Signature Visuals
- Storytelling Visuals

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute or have suggestions for additional analyses, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
